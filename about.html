      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Paw Art celebrates the creativity of cats. We explore how simple, playful activities like paw painting can become a medium of artistic expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to educate cat owners about safe, fun, and artistic ways to bond with their pets while producing unique artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through careful observation and experimentation, we document the variety of textures, patterns, and colors that cats naturally create with their paws.
      </p>

      <h2>Techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Paw Painting: Using non-toxic paints on paper or canvas.</li>
        <li>Stamping: Cats gently step on pre-painted pads or stamps.</li>
        <li>Mixed Media: Combining paw prints with other art elements for creative effects.</li>
